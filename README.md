Polar Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where two players take turns making a move on the board with their mark: an X or an O.
This game is much like regular tic-tac-toe except that the board is circular, consisting of 4 rings and 6 axis. 
Moves are allowed anywhere a ring and axis intersect, except for the center. 
A win must have 4 consecutive marks from a single player, either adjacent along an axis, adjacent along a ring, or diagonally adjacent.

Two player mode is implemented for a single computer.
